#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Gray to Binary Converter:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains Gray to Binary Converter circuit with NAND gates which contains input switches and red LED for gray code input and green LED for binary code output. Red LED will glow according to the gray code provided at input through switches and correspondingly green LED will glow with respect to binary code at output converted by the circuit.<br>
Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide gray code input to simulator, predict the output of binary code and verify it by truth table.<br>
